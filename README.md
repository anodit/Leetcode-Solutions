# LeetCode Solutions (Java)

This repository contains my **LeetCode solutions in Java**, organized by problem ranges for easy navigation and revision.  
Each problem solution file follows a consistent format:

- **Question** → problem statement (copied from LeetCode with examples and constraints).  
- **Solution(s)** → Java implementations (from brute force to optimal).  
- **Approach** → explanation of the method used.  
- **Intuition** → reasoning behind the solution.
