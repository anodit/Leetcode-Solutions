üìù Problem: Fix Names in a Table (LeetCode #1667)
Table: Users
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.


This table contains the ID and the name of the user.

The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.

We need to fix the names so that:

Only the first character is uppercase

The rest of the characters are lowercase

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

Example 1

Input:

Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+


Output:

+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+

‚úÖ Solution (MySQL)
SELECT 
    user_id,
    CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;

üîé Explanation

LEFT(name, 1) ‚Üí Extracts the first character of the name.

UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)) ‚Üí Converts the first character to uppercase.

SUBSTRING(name, 2) ‚Üí Gets the substring from the second character onwards.

LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2)) ‚Üí Converts the rest of the characters to lowercase.

CONCAT(...) ‚Üí Joins them back together.

Finally, we order the result by user_id as required.

‚ö° This query runs in O(n) where n = number of rows in the table.
